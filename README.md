**Demo:** https://hengameh.github.io/react-shopping-list/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview
Here you found my simple, responsive React Shopping list. Now find out about the basic requirement of this app

1. Create React apps with no build configuration ([Creating an App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app#creating-an-app))
2. This app will display a text input for the user, where they will be able to write a shopping item. Eg. "a dozen eggs", "detergent".
3. A button labeled "Add to Shopping list" should be displayed beside the input. When clicked, this button should add the user's input to a list of shopping items.
4. Blank items should not be added to the list. This can happen if the user presses the add button without writing down a task.
5. Users should be able to add items to the list by using the "Enter" key as well.
6. The list could potentially have 0 to multiple items.
7. After adding an item, the text input must be emptied automatically.
8. Each list item must display the shopping item name and a button labeled "delete".
9. When clicking on the delete button, the list item should be removed from the list.

Note: Like always make sure to break down this project into steps rather than trying to do everything at once. Enjoy!
